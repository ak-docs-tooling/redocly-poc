# XRPL Basic Concepts

This interactive training program is designed to help you understand how to create and edit content using Redocly's developer portal.
It's a great companion to our [developer portal docs](https://docs.redoc.ly/developer-portal/introduction/).

Spend between an hour and a day playing with the most commonly utilized features.

## Prerequisites
- Basic Git and markdown knowledge
- Node and yarn installed
- A text editor or IDE (we like VS Code)
- [Setup the developer portal](setup.md)

## Getting Started

Follow the training exercises sequentially.
Or cherry-pick them independently if you're limited on time.

- [Plain markdown pages](markdown.md)
- [Changing the url paths](awesome/folders.md)
- [Markdown with a mermaid diagram](mermaid.md)
- [The page table of contents](page-table-of-contents.md)

Upon completion, you may have questions, or you may be ready to start building your content out.
Learn how to [deploy the developer portal](https://docs.redoc.ly/ci-cd-workflows/) to our global CDN or contact us about purchasing an enterprise license key.
